# Requirements Document

## Introduction

이 프로젝트는 AWS Strands와 같은 AI Agent 시스템을 구축할 수 있도록 도와주는 프레임워크입니다. 개발자들이 복잡한 인프라나 반복적인 구현 작업에 시간을 쓰지 않고, Agent의 비즈니스 로직과 핵심 기능에만 집중할 수 있도록 필수적인 기능들을 추상화하여 제공합니다. 이를 통해 Agentic 시스템의 핵심 구성 요소들을 이해하고, 어떤 부분이 추상화 가능하며 어떤 부분이 사용자가 직접 구현해야 하는 mission-critical한 영역인지 파악할 수 있습니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple agent orchestration system, so that I can define and manage multiple agents without dealing with complex coordination logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer defines multiple agents THEN the system SHALL provide a centralized orchestration mechanism
2. WHEN agents need to communicate THEN the system SHALL handle message routing automatically
3. WHEN an agent fails THEN the system SHALL provide error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. IF agents have dependencies THEN the system SHALL manage execution order appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized tool integration capabilities, so that I can easily connect agents to external services and APIs without writing boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent needs to call external APIs THEN the system SHALL provide a unified tool interface
2. WHEN integrating common services (databases, file systems, web APIs) THEN the system SHALL offer pre-built connectors
3. WHEN a tool call fails THEN the system SHALL handle retries and error responses automatically
4. IF custom tools are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a simple plugin architecture

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want built-in conversation and context management, so that I can focus on agent logic rather than managing conversation state and memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent processes user input THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history automatically
2. WHEN context needs to be shared between agents THEN the system SHALL provide context passing mechanisms
3. WHEN conversation history grows large THEN the system SHALL manage memory efficiently with summarization
4. IF specific context retrieval is needed THEN the system SHALL provide query mechanisms for historical data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible LLM provider abstraction, so that I can switch between different AI models without changing my agent code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining an agent THEN the system SHALL allow LLM provider selection through configuration
2. WHEN switching providers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent interfaces
3. WHEN a provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL support fallback mechanisms
4. IF custom prompting strategies are needed THEN the system SHALL allow prompt template customization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple workflow definition capabilities, so that I can create multi-step agent processes without complex state management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining agent workflows THEN the system SHALL provide a declarative workflow syntax
2. WHEN workflows have conditional logic THEN the system SHALL support branching and decision points
3. WHEN workflows need human input THEN the system SHALL provide approval and input mechanisms
4. IF workflows fail at any step THEN the system SHALL provide rollback and recovery options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want built-in monitoring and observability, so that I can understand how my agents are performing without implementing custom logging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents execute THEN the system SHALL log all actions and decisions automatically
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and timing information
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL offer detailed execution traces
4. IF custom metrics are required THEN the system SHALL allow metric extension points

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple configuration system, so that I can deploy agents across different environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying agents THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations
2. WHEN secrets are needed THEN the system SHALL provide secure credential management
3. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL support configuration-based scaling parameters
4. IF configuration changes THEN the system SHALL allow hot-reloading without restarts
